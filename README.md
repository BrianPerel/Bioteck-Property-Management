Property Management App

## The Problem:
* We need a program that will keep track of finances, properties, candidates, and current tenants of 2 Apartment Complexes
* 1 apartment complex is in Los Angeles and 1 is in Boston
* We will create a web site that can take down candidate information for apartments and store that data along with current renter and finance information in a database
* Different User's will have different views of database; if candidate comes to page he will see regular candidate form page, apartment complex and apartment informational page
* If Owner comes to page he will click on the finances page, login, and see finance, tenant, and candidate information

## Our Vision:
* Ideally we want to have different windows (views) for different people:
Candidates, The Property Owner, The Book Keeper / finance person

## Our Approach:
* Break up the different portions of the site
* Have an application form page for the candidates to fill out
* Have a page for room information and offerings
* Have a page for viewing finances (book keeper and Property Owner)


## Idea / Goal:
* Create a full functioning website that takes information from a website, puts it into a database when user clicks various buttons, and have the structure of the database be controlled by an Object Oriented Java Model in the back-end

* 1. Start with a Java OOP model with a set of classes, 2. have input validation, 3.
create a database in mySQL, 4. use Hibernate ORM framework for object relational mapping to map our object oriented domain model to a relational db, 5. create web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
use AngularJS to make the pages dynamic, allowing the data to be placed into the database
